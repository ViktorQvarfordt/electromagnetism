# A mathematical approach to electromagnetism

**Note:** At this stage this is nothing more than an experiment.

The PDF is available
[here](https://dl.dropbox.com/s/m48ha31d68autfc/electromagnetism.pdf),
my latest compiled version. *(Only the source is hosted in this repo,
the pdf is not included. Git is not really suited for tracking binary
files â€” and Dropbox is not well suited for multi-user editing.)*

## Why?

The intentions of this project is to give a concise view of the theory
in a "mathematical approach"; with definitions, theorems and proofs,
also derivations of common and/or fundamental results. *No handwaving
allowed!* That is left for the textbooks, which often spend too much
time talking and too little time giving proper and rigorous derivations.

## Contributing

All contributions are welcome!

Make a pull request, or I can give you direct permissions to the repo.

If you're not comfortable with git or LaTeX, just contact me with your
ideas, or send me text in your preferred format which I then simply
LaTeX-ify and add to the document.
